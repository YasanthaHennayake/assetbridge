# Sprint 2: User Authentication & Authorization

**Sprint Duration:** TBD
**Sprint Goal:** Implement complete user authentication system with modern navigation, user management, and comprehensive testing

**Status:** Planning

---

## Sprint Overview

This sprint focuses on building a secure, modern authentication system for AssetBridge. The implementation will use JWT for session management, bcrypt for password security, and establish the foundation for future Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation.

---

## Sprint Objectives

1. Implement JWT-based authentication system
2. Create modern application navigation with Settings module
3. Build user management interface (CRUD operations)
4. Implement first-time login password change flow
5. Establish comprehensive test coverage (API, Frontend, E2E)

---

## Database Schema

### Users Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String (required),
  email: String (required, unique, lowercase),
  password: String (required, hashed),
  mustChangePassword: Boolean (default: false),
  createdAt: Date (default: Date.now),
  updatedAt: Date (default: Date.now),
  lastLogin: Date (optional)
}

// Indexes
- email: unique index
- createdAt: ascending index
```

---

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate user, return JWT token
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Invalidate user session
- `POST /api/auth/change-password` - Change user password
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current authenticated user info

### Users
- `GET /api/users` - List all users (paginated, requires auth)
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user (requires auth/admin)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID (requires auth)
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user (requires auth)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user (requires auth/admin, optional)

---

## Frontend Routes

```
/ → Redirect to /login or /dashboard (based on auth state)
/login → Login page (public)
/dashboard → Dashboard (protected)
/settings → Settings layout (protected)
  /settings/users → User list (protected)
  /settings/users/new → Add user form (protected)
  /settings/users/:id → View/Edit user (protected)
/change-password → Password change page (protected, forced on first login)
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Security**
   - Bcrypt hashing with 10+ salt rounds
   - Minimum password requirements enforced
   - No plain text password storage or transmission

2. **Token Management**
   - JWT with appropriate expiration (e.g., 24 hours)
   - Secure token storage (httpOnly cookies preferred, or localStorage with XSS precautions)
   - Token validation on every protected route

3. **API Security**
   - All routes except login require authentication
   - Input validation using express-validator
   - Rate limiting on login endpoint (future enhancement)
   - HTTPS only in production

4. **Frontend Security**
   - XSS prevention (React's built-in escaping)
   - CSRF protection (if using cookies)
   - Secure password field handling
   - No sensitive data in localStorage (except token if necessary)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| JWT implementation complexity | Medium | Low | Use well-documented libraries (jsonwebtoken), follow best practices |
| Password security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Use bcrypt, follow OWASP guidelines, comprehensive testing |
| E2E test flakiness | Low | Medium | Use Playwright best practices, add explicit waits, retry logic |
| Token expiration handling | Medium | Medium | Implement refresh token mechanism (future), clear error messages |
| UI/UX complexity for navigation | Low | Low | Start with simple design, iterate based on feedback |

---

## Notes

- This sprint establishes the foundation for RBAC, which will be implemented in a future sprint
- The authentication architecture is designed to be extensible for future features (MFA, SSO, etc.)
- Focus on security best practices from the start to avoid refactoring later
- Comprehensive testing is critical for authentication systems
