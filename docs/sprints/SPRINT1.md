# SPRINT 1 - Foundation Setup with Hello World

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational monorepo architecture, development environment, and CI/CD pipeline with a simple Hello World API and frontend to validate the entire stack.

## Sprint Duration
**Started**: October 14, 2025
**Completed**: October 15, 2025
**Total Duration**: 2 days

## User Stories & Tasks

### 1. Monorepo Infrastructure Setup
**Priority**: Critical
**Story**: As a developer, I need a properly configured monorepo structure so that I can develop frontend and backend independently.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Initialize monorepo structure (chosen: npm workspaces)
- [x] Create `/packages/backend` workspace with Node.js + Express

- [x] Create `/packages/shared` workspace for common types/utilities
- [x] Configure TypeScript for all workspaces
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Create root package.json with workspace scripts (dev, build, test)
- [x] Add .gitignore for node_modules, .env, build outputs

### 2. Backend - Hello World API
**Priority**: Critical
**Story**: As a developer, I need a working API endpoint so that I can validate the backend setup.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Set up Express server with TypeScript
- [x] Create `/api/hello` GET endpoint that returns `{ message: "Hello World from AssetBridge!" }`

### 7. Documentation
**Priority**: Medium
**Story**: As a developer, I need setup instructions so that I can start development quickly.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with development setup commands
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation structure under `/docs`:
  - Project structure
  - Prerequisites (Node.js version, MongoDB Atlas account)
  - Installation steps
  - Development commands (npm run dev, npm test, npm run build)
- [x] Document environment variables needed
- [x] Create detailed guides:
  - Local development guide (`docs/guides/local-development.md`)
  - GitHub Actions deployment guide (`docs/guides/github-actions-deployment.md`)
  - E2E testing guide (`docs/guides/e2e-testing.md`)
- [x] Establish bug tracking system (`docs/bugs/`)
- [x] Document resolved issues (BUG-001)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Monorepo structure is set up with backend, frontend, and shared packages
- [x] Backend API returns "Hello World" message at `/api/hello`
- [x] Frontend displays the message fetched from backend
- [x] MongoDB Atlas is connected and verified
- [x] Basic tests are written and passing for both frontend and backend
- [x] CI/CD pipeline runs tests on every push
- [x] Application is deployed to Heroku (both frontend and backend)
- [x] Documentation is complete with setup instructions
- [x] Demo: Visit deployed URL and see "Hello World from AssetBridge!" on screen
  - Frontend: https://assetbridge.hikvision.lk
  - Backend: https://api.assetbridge.hikvision.lk

## Technical Decisions
- **Monorepo Tool**: npm workspaces (simple, built-in, no additional dependencies)
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 + Vite 4 + TypeScript
- **Backend Framework**: Express + TypeScript + Node.js 18
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted, production-ready)
- **Testing**:
  - Backend: Jest
  - Frontend: Vitest (unit tests) + Playwright (E2E tests with console error detection)
- **Deployment**: Heroku (dual-dyno architecture)
  - Backend dyno: Express API
  - Frontend dyno: Static file serving with `serve` package
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
  - Branch strategy: feature â†’ main â†’ release
  - Automated testing on all branches
  - Automated deployment on release branch only
- **SSL/TLS**: Heroku ACM (Automatic Certificate Management) with Let's Encrypt
- **Custom Domains**:
  - Frontend: assetbridge.hikvision.lk
  - Backend API: api.assetbridge.hikvision.lk

## Out of Scope for Sprint 1
- Authentication and authorization
- User management
- Any business modules (Vendor, Purchase Request, etc.)
- Complex UI components or styling
- Production-level error monitoring and logging

## Notes
- Keep everything simple and focused on infrastructure
- The Hello World example validates the entire stack
- This sprint creates the foundation for all future development
- Focus on getting the CI/CD pipeline working end-to-end

## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well âœ…

1. **Rapid Setup**: Completed full-stack infrastructure in 2 days
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implemented 3-tier testing (Jest, Vitest, Playwright)
3. **Production-Ready Deployment**: Successfully deployed with custom domains and SSL
4. **Excellent Documentation**: Created extensive guides that serve as knowledge base
5. **Problem Solving**: Debugged and resolved complex deployment issues (BUG-001)
6. **Modern Stack**: Selected proven, maintainable technologies

### Challenges Encountered ðŸ”§

1. **Heroku Deployment Issues** (BUG-001):
   - Third-party GitHub Action unreliable
   - Git authentication required .netrc configuration
   - Monorepo build order caused module resolution failures
   - **Resolution**: Manual Heroku CLI installation, .netrc setup, sequential builds

2. **SSL Certificate Configuration**:
   - ACM was disabled by default on both apps
   - **Resolution**: Enabled ACM on both frontend and backend apps

3. **Environment Variables in Vite**:
   - Initial confusion about build-time vs runtime variables
   - **Resolution**: Properly configured VITE_API_URL in Heroku and triggered rebuild

### Key Learnings ðŸ“š

1. **Monorepo Build Dependencies**: NPM workspaces don't automatically order builds. Explicit sequencing required when packages have compile-time dependencies.

2. **Heroku Deployment**: Official tools (Heroku CLI) are more reliable than third-party actions. Non-interactive environments need explicit credential configuration.

3. **Vite Environment Variables**: Environment variables are baked into the build at compile-time, not runtime. Changes require redeployment.

4. **Documentation Value**: Detailed bug reports during investigation saved time and created valuable reference material.

### Metrics ðŸ“Š

- **Total Commits**: ~15 commits across feature branches
- **Bugs Resolved**: 1 major deployment issue (BUG-001)
- **Documentation Created**: 5 comprehensive guides
- **Test Coverage**: Backend and frontend unit tests + E2E tests
- **Deployment Success Rate**: 100% after fixes
- **Sprint Goal Achievement**: 100% - All DoD items completed

### Action Items for Next Sprint ðŸŽ¯

1. âœ… Consider adding health check monitoring for production
2. âœ… Implement automated database backup strategy
3. âœ… Set up error tracking service (Sentry, etc.)
4. âœ… Add performance monitoring
5. âœ… Begin Sprint 2: User authentication and role-based access control

### Sprint Success Criteria: ACHIEVED âœ¨

All planned features delivered, documented, tested, and deployed to production with custom domains and SSL certificates. The foundation is solid and ready for feature development.

**Production URLs**:
- Frontend: https://assetbridge.hikvision.lk âœ…
- Backend API: https://api.assetbridge.hikvision.lk âœ…
