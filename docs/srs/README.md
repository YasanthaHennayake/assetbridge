# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

This directory contains Software Requirements Specification documents for AssetBridge.

## Purpose

The SRS documents define the functional and non-functional requirements for the AssetBridge system. These documents serve as:

- **Requirements Reference** - Detailed specifications for all system features
- **Development Guide** - Clear requirements for implementing features
- **Testing Baseline** - Criteria for verifying feature completion
- **Stakeholder Communication** - Common understanding of system capabilities

```

## Document Template

Each SRS document should follow this structure:

### 1. Overview
- Module/feature description
- Purpose and objectives
- Related modules

### 2. Functional Requirements
- **FR-XXX**: Requirement ID and description
- Priority: High/Medium/Low
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria

### 3. User Interface Requirements
- Screen layouts
- User workflows
- Navigation

### 4. Data Requirements
- Data models
- Validation rules
- Business rules

### 5. Integration Requirements
- APIs and endpoints
- External integrations
- Inter-module dependencies

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance criteria
- Security considerations
- Accessibility requirements

## Requirements Tracking

### Requirement ID Format

- **FR-XXX**: Functional Requirement (e.g., FR-001)
- **NFR-XXX**: Non-Functional Requirement (e.g., NFR-001)
- **UI-XXX**: User Interface Requirement (e.g., UI-001)

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Description | Implementation Timeline |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Core functionality required for system operation | Sprint 2-3 |
| **P1 - High** | Important features for primary workflows | Sprint 4-5 |
| **P2 - Medium** | Enhances user experience and efficiency | Sprint 6-7 |
| **P3 - Low** | Nice-to-have features | Future sprints |

### Requirement States

- **Draft** - Being written/reviewed
- **Approved** - Reviewed and ready for implementation
- **In Development** - Currently being implemented
- **Implemented** - Code complete
- **Tested** - Passed testing
- **Deployed** - In production

## Creating New SRS Documents

When adding a new SRS document:

1. **Copy the template** (if one exists) or follow the structure above
2. **Use clear requirement IDs** following the format above
3. **Include acceptance criteria** for each requirement
4. **Add user stories** where applicable
5. **Link to related documents** (features, bugs, sprints)
6. **Update this README** with the new document

Example:
```bash
# Create new SRS document
cp docs/srs/TEMPLATE.md docs/srs/functional/new-module.md

# Edit the document
# Add requirements with IDs, priorities, and acceptance criteria

# Reference in CLAUDE.md if it's a major module
```

## Integration with Development

### Linking Requirements to Code

In code comments, reference requirements:
```typescript
/**
 * Vendor registration form
 * Implements: FR-101, FR-102, UI-025
 */
export const VendorRegistrationForm = () => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Linking Requirements to Tests

In test files, reference requirements:
```typescript
describe('Vendor Registration (FR-101)', () => {
  test('should validate vendor email format (FR-101.2)', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Linking Requirements to Features

In feature documentation:
```markdown
# Vendor Management Feature

**Implements Requirements:**
- FR-101: Vendor registration
- FR-102: Vendor profile management
- FR-103: Vendor evaluation
```

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

- **Be Specific** - Clear, measurable requirements
- **Include Acceptance Criteria** - Define "done"
- **Prioritize** - Mark critical vs. nice-to-have
- **Update Regularly** - Keep documents current
- **Link to Features** - Connect requirements to implementation
- **Use Examples** - Include screenshots, mockups, workflows

### DON'T ❌

- **Be Vague** - Avoid ambiguous language
- **Mix Requirements** - Keep functional and non-functional separate
- **Skip Acceptance Criteria** - Always define success criteria
- **Ignore Dependencies** - Document related requirements
- **Forget Traceability** - Link requirements to code and tests

## Review Process

Before marking requirements as "Approved":

1. **Completeness Check** - All sections filled in?
2. **Clarity Check** - Requirements clear and unambiguous?
3. **Feasibility Check** - Technically possible within constraints?
4. **Consistency Check** - Aligns with other requirements?
5. **Testability Check** - Can be verified through testing?

- **[docs/sprints/](../sprints/)** - Sprint planning with requirements
- **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)** - Architecture and development guide
- **[docs/bugs/](../bugs/)** - Bug reports (may reference requirements)

## Future Enhancements

As the project grows, consider:

- Requirements traceability matrix
- Automated requirement-to-code linking
- Version control for requirement changes
- Stakeholder sign-off workflow

**Note**: This is a living document. As AssetBridge evolves, update the SRS structure and templates to better serve the project's needs.
