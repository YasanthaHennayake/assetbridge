- The authentication architecture MUST be designed to support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation in future releases
- Password storage SHALL use industry-standard hashing algorithms (bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds)

### 2. User Login

**REQ-AUTH-002: Username/Password Login**
- Users SHALL authenticate using username and password credentials
- The system SHALL NOT provide a public signup/registration screen at the login interface
- Only administrators can create new user accounts through the Settings interface

**REQ-AUTH-003: Login Interface**

- Additional fields may be added in future iterations to support RBAC (roles, permissions, department assignments)

### 4. Application Navigation

**REQ-AUTH-005: Modern Navigation Structure**
- The application SHALL implement a modern navigation interface
- Initial implementation SHALL include a "Settings" tab in the main navigation
- Navigation structure MUST be extensible to accommodate future modules (Vendor Management, Purchase Request, Purchase Order, GRN, Stock)

**REQ-AUTH-006: Settings Navigation**
- The Settings section SHALL contain a "Users" sub-item
- Navigation SHALL support hierarchical menu structure for future settings categories

### 5. User Management

**REQ-AUTH-007: User List View**
- The Users section SHALL display a list of all registered users
- The list SHALL show relevant user information (name, email, status)
- The interface SHALL provide actions for viewing, editing, and managing users

**REQ-AUTH-008: Add New User**
- Administrators SHALL be able to create new user accounts through the Users interface
- The system SHALL automatically generate a random secure password when creating a new user
- The generated password SHALL meet security requirements:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- The generated password SHALL be displayed to the administrator once upon creation
- The new user account SHALL be flagged as requiring password change on first login

### 6. First-Time Login and Password Change

**REQ-AUTH-009: First Login Password Change**
- When a user logs in for the first time, the system SHALL immediately prompt them to change their password
- The user SHALL NOT be able to access any other part of the application until the password is changed
- The password change form SHALL require:
  - Current password (the randomly generated one)
  - New password
  - Confirm new password

**REQ-AUTH-010: Password Change Validation**
- The system SHALL validate that new passwords meet security requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters (configurable)

  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- The system SHALL prevent reuse of the initial generated password
- Password confirmation SHALL match the new password

**REQ-AUTH-011: Password Change Flag**
- After successful password change, the system SHALL clear the "first login" flag
- Subsequent logins SHALL proceed directly to the application without password change prompt

## Testing Requirements

### 7. API Testing

### 9. End-to-End Testing

**REQ-TEST-005: Complete User Lifecycle E2E Test**
- A comprehensive E2E test SHALL be implemented covering the complete user lifecycle:

**Test Flow:**
1. **Admin Login**
   - Login as administrator user
   - Navigate to Settings > Users

2. **Create New User**
   - Click "Add User" button
   - Fill in user details (name, email)
   - System generates random password
   - Capture generated password
   - Save new user
   - Verify user appears in user list

3. **Admin Logout**
   - Logout from admin account
   - Verify redirected to login page

4. **New User First Login**

10. Code is documented and follows project standards

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Recommended Technologies
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt
- **Frontend State Management**: React Context API or Redux for auth state
- **Password Generation**: Crypto-secure random generation library

### Database Schema Considerations
```typescript
interface User {
  _id: ObjectId;
  name: string;
  email: string;        // unique index
  password: string;     // hashed
  mustChangePassword: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  lastLogin?: Date;
  // Future RBAC fields:
  // roles?: string[];
  // permissions?: string[];
  // departmentId?: ObjectId;
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate user
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - End user session
- `POST /api/auth/change-password` - Change user password
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info
- `GET /api/users` - List all users (admin only)
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user (admin only)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user (if needed)
